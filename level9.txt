sort data.txt | uniq - u

NOTE: 
1. uniq only detect duplicate lines that are adjacent to each other, which is why we need to sort first
2. -u flag in uniq will output lines that are not repeated consecutively
3. Using the pipe '|' operator in Linux, it connects stdout to stdin
4. sort data.txt will send the sorted lines to stdout
5. uniq -u reads from stdin and filters only the lines that are unique
