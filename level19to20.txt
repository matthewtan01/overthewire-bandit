ls -l (to list the files as well as its permissions)
-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 14884 Jul 28 19:03 bandit20-do

take note of the -rwsr-x---, in the owner permissions, there is an s instead of the usual x.
s in place of x means that the setuid bit is set and the owner has execute permissions.
this cause the program to run with privileges of the file owner, not the person running it.

only owner (bandit20) and group (bandit19) are able to execute the file

to run the program: ./bandit20-do

./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
