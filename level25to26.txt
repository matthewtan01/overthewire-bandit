To see the shell of user bandit 26,
cat /etc/passwd | grep '^bandit26'
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtext

cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh
export TERM=linux
exec more ~/text.txt
exit 0

NOTE: 
exec command in Linux is used to replace the current process with a new process.
When you run a command normally in the shell, the shell will fork a new process,
and the command run in that child process. The shell then waits for the child 
process to complete. With exec, no new process is forked. Instead, the program
specified after exec directly replaces the shell's process.

NOTE: 
more command is used to display text bit by bit according to the terminal size

We need to limit the terminal size in order to not get exitted after SSH into bandit26.
When more is displaying a file, we can launch an editor (vim)

In vim, exit to normal mode using Esc button
In vim normal mode, we have access to Vim's command interface (:)

:set shell=/bin/bash        # tells vim to use bash when executing external shell commands
:shell                      # launch an interactive shell 

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
