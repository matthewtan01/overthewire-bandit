To scan for ports in the range of 31000 to 32000 that are open and have a service listening
nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost

can add the -sV flag to show which service is running on SSL

Locate the right port by trial and error,
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet
(since the key for previous exercise starts with k, need to add the -quiet option, or else KEY UPDATE will appear)

After getting the RSA KEY,
TEMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
cd $TEMPDIR
vim rsa.key

chmod 600 rsa.key

ssh -i rsa.key bandit17@localhost -p 2220

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17
